#### Why This Error Occurred

You specified the `--team` flag and specified the slug of a team that does not exist or that you're not a part of.

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

If you're sure the team exists, please make sure that you're a part of it (ask an owner of the team to invite you). After that, the command will work.

Otherwise, either create a team with the specified slug or ensure that the slug is correct if you're sure that the team exists.
