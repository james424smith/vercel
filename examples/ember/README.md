# Ember Example

This directory is a brief example of an [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) app that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Ember project with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/zeit/now/tree/master/examples/ember)

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Ember for deployment with Vercel, you can use the [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx ember-cli new ember-project
```

### Deploying From Your Terminal

You can deploy your new Ember project with a single command from your terminal using [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download):
