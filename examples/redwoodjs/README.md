# RedwoodJS Example

This directory is a brief example of a [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) app with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own RedwoodJS project, along with Serverless Functions, with Vercel.

### How We Created This Example

To get started with RedwoodJS on Vercel, you can [use Yarn to initialize](https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial/installation-starting-development) the project:

```shell
$ yarn create redwood-app ./my-redwood-app
```

### Deploying From Your Terminal

You can deploy your new RedwoodJS project, along with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction), with a single command from your terminal using [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download):
