# &#120491; now

The fastest way to deploy a Node.JS service.

## How it works

In any directory with a `package.json`, run:

```bash
$ now
> https://some-code-nd23n2.now.sh
```

every time you run it, you get a new URL (unless nothing's changed).

### Conventions

1. `package.json` must contain a `start` task inside `scripts`.
   If a `now` script is defined, that's used instead.
2. Only files that would be included in `npm publish` are synchronized.
   `package.json` `files` field, `.npmignore` and `.gitignore` are supported.
3. If a build step is needed, specify a `build` task in `scripts`.
   If `now-build` is defined, that's used instead.

## Installing

```bash
$ npm install -g now
