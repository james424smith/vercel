## Usage

Vercel is the optimal workflow for frontend teams. All-in-one: Static and Jamstack deployment, Serverless Functions, and Global CDN.

Get started by [Importing a Git Project](https://vercel.com/import) and use `git push` to deploy. Alternatively, you can [install Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download).

## Documentation

## Caught a Bug?

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Compile the code: `yarn build`
4. Link the package to the global module directory: `cd ./packages/now-cli && yarn link`
5. You can start using `vercel` anywhere inside the command line

As always, you should use `yarn test-unit` to run the tests and see if your changes have broken anything.
