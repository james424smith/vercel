# Scope Not Existent

#### Why This Error Occurred

You specified the `--scope` flag and specified the ID or slug of a team that does not exist or that you're not a part of. Similarly you might have specified the ID or username of user whose account you don't own.

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

If you're sure the specified team exists, please make sure that you're a part of it (ask an owner of the team to invite you). If you specified the identifier of a user, make sure you are actually the owner of this account.

Otherwise, either create a team with the specified slug or ensure that the identifier is correct if you're sure that the scope exists.
