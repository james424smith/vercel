# Riot Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Riot.js](https://riot.js.org/) app that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example

To get started with Riot on Now, you can use the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ now init riot
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Riot example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
