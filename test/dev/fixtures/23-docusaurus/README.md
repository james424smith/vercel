# Docusauras Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Docusauras](https://docusaurus.io/) site that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example

To get started with Docusauras on Now, you can use the [Docusauras CLI](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ docusauras-init
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Docusauras example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
