# Docz Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Docz](https://www.docz.site/) site that can be deployed with ZEIT Now and zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Docz project with ZEIT Now.

[![Deploy with ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/button)](https://zeit.co/import/project?template=https://github.com/zeit/now/tree/master/examples/docz)

_Live Example: https://docz.now-examples.now.sh_

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Docz for deployment with ZEIT Now, you can use the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ now init docz
```

> The only change made is to add `dest: '/public'` to the `doczrc.js` file.

### Deploying From Your Terminal

You can deploy your new Docz project with a single command from your terminal using [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download):

```shell
$ now
```
