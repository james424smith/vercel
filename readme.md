## Caught a Bug?

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
2. Link the package to the global module directory: `yarn run link` (not `yarn link`)
3. You can now start using `now` from the command line!

As always, you can use `yarn test` to run the tests and see if your changes have broken anything.

## How to Create a Release

If you have write access to this repository, this is how you can create a new release: 

- **Stable release:** Run `release <major|minor|patch>` (depending on the version bump you're planning to do) on the `master` branch.

- **Canary release:** Run `release pre` on the `canary` branch.

After you've run the command, monitor [this page](https://circleci.com/gh/zeit/now-cli) and wait for Circle CI to upload the binaries to the release. Once that's done and the tests are passing, hit "Publish" on the GitHub release.
