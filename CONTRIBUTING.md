# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue or [spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/zeit) with the owners of this repository before submitting a Pull Request.

Please read our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Local development

This project is configured in a monorepo pattern where one repo contains multiple npm packages. Dependencies are installed and managed with `yarn`, not `npm` CLI. 

To get started, execute the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/zeit/now-builders
yarn install
yarn bootstrap
yarn build
yarn lint
yarn test
```

Make sure all the tests pass before making changes.

## Verifying your change

Once you are done with your changes (we even suggest doing it along the way ), make sure all the test still run by running

```
yarn build && yarn test
```

from the root of the project.

If any test fails, make sure to fix it along with your changes. See [Interpreting test errors](#Interpreting-test-errors) for more information about how the tests are executed, especially the integration tests.

## Pull Request Process

Once you are confident that your changes work properly, open a pull request on the main repository.

The pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers and the tests will be checked by our continuous integration platform.

## Interpreting test errors

There are 2 kinds of tests in this repository â€“ Unit tests and Integration tests.
 
Unit tests are run locally with `jest` and execute quickly because they are testing the smallest units of code.

### Integration tests

Integration tests create deployments to your ZEIT account using the `test` project name. After each test is deployed, the `probes` key is used to check if the response is the expected value. If the value doesn't match, you'll see a message explaining the difference. If the deployment failed to build, you'll see a more generic message like the following:

```
[Error: Fetched page https://test-8ashcdlew.now.sh/root.js does not contain hello Root!. Instead it contains An error occurred with this application.

    NO_STATUS_CODE_FRO Response headers:
       cache-control=s-maxage=0
      connection=close
      content-type=text/plain; charset=utf-8
      date=Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:01:37 GMT
      server=now
      strict-transport-security=max-age=63072000
      transfer-encoding=chunked
      x-now-id=iad1:hgtzj-1560967297876-44ae12559f95
      x-now-trace=iad1]
```

In such cases you can visit the URL of the failed deployment and append `/_logs` so see the build error. In the case above, that would be https://test-8ashcdlew.now.sh/_logs

The logs of this deployment will contain the actual error which may help you to understand what went wrong.

### @zeit/ncc integration

Some of the builders use `@zeit/ncc` to bundle files before deployment. If you suspect an error with the bundling mechanism, you can run the `ncc` CLI with a couple modifications to the test.

For example if an error occurred in `now-node/test/fixtures/08-assets`

```
cd packages/now-node/test/fixtures/08-assets
yarn install
echo 'require("http").createServer(module.exports).listen(3000)' >> index.js
npx @zeit/ncc@0.20.1 build index.js --source-map
node dist
```

This will compile the test with the specific version of `ncc` and run the resulting file. If it fails here, then there is likely a bug in `ncc` and not the Builder.
