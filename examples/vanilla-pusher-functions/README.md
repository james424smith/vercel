# Realtime Pusher Whiteboard

This directory is a realtime serverless whiteboard powered by Pusher. The frontend is static vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and the backend is a single Node.js function.

To get started with a realtime whiteboard on Now, you can use [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ now init vanilla-pusher-functions
```

## Deploying This Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
