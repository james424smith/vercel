# Missing Team Value

#### Why This Error Occurred

The `--team` flag was specified, but there's no value for it available.

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

In order to make it work, you need to specify a value for the `--team` flag. This needs to be the slug of the team as which you'd like to act.

As an example, if your team URL is `https://zeit.co/teams/zeit`, the slug of the team is `zeit`.
