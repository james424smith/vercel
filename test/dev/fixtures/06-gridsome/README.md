# Gridsome Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) app that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example 

To get started with Gridsome on Now, you can use the [Gridsome CLI](https://gridsome.org/docs/gridsome-cli/) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ gridsome create my-website
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Gridsome example with just a single command:
