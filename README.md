## Caught a Bug?

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
2. Link the package to the global module directory: `npm link`
3. Transpile the source code and watch for changes: `npm start`
4. You can now start using `now` from the command line!

As always, you can use `npm test` to run the tests and see if your changes have broken anything.
