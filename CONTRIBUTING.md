# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/zeit/now/issues/new) or [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/zeit) with the owners of this repository before submitting a Pull Request.

Please read our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Local development

This project is configured in a monorepo pattern where one repo contains multiple npm packages. Dependencies are installed and managed with `yarn`, not `npm` CLI.

To get started, execute the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/zeit/now
yarn install
yarn bootstrap
yarn build
yarn lint
yarn test
```

Make sure all the tests pass before making changes.

## Verifying your change

Once you are done with your changes (we even suggest doing it along the way ), make sure all the test still run by running

```
yarn build && yarn test
```

from the root of the project.

If any test fails, make sure to fix it along with your changes. See [Interpreting test errors](#Interpreting-test-errors) for more information about how the tests are executed, especially the integration tests.

## Pull Request Process

Once you are confident that your changes work properly, open a pull request on the main repository.

The pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers and the tests will be checked by our continuous integration platform.

## Interpreting test errors

There are 2 kinds of tests in this repository â€“ Unit tests and Integration tests.

Unit tests are run locally with `jest` and execute quickly because they are testing the smallest units of code.

### Integration tests

Integration tests create deployments to your ZEIT account using the `test` project name. After each test is deployed, the `probes` key is used to check if the response is the expected value. If the value doesn't match, you'll see a message explaining the difference. If the deployment failed to build, you'll see a more generic message like the following:

```
[Error: Fetched page https://test-8ashcdlew.now.sh/root.js does not contain hello Root!. Instead it contains An error occurred with this application.

    NO_STATUS_CODE_FRO Response headers:
       cache-control=s-maxage=0
      connection=close
      content-type=text/plain; charset=utf-8
      date=Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:01:37 GMT
      server=now
      strict-transport-security=max-age=63072000
      transfer-encoding=chunked
      x-now-id=iad1:hgtzj-1560967297876-44ae12559f95
      x-now-trace=iad1]
```

In such cases you can visit the URL of the failed deployment and append `/_logs` so see the build error. In the case above, that would be https://test-8ashcdlew.now.sh/_logs

The logs of this deployment will contain the actual error which may help you to understand what went wrong.

### @zeit/node-file-trace

Some of the Builders use `@zeit/node-file-trace` to tree-shake files before deployment. If you suspect an error with this tree-shaking mechanism, you can create the following script in your project:

```js
const trace = require('@zeit/node-file-trace');
trace(['path/to/entrypoint.js'], {
  ts: true,
  mixedModules: true,
})
  .then(o => console.log(o.fileList))
  .then(e => console.error(e));
```

When you run this script, you'll see all imported files. If anything file is missing, the bug is in [@zeit/node-file-trace](https://github.com/zeit/node-file-trace) and not the Builder.

## Deploy a Builder with existing project

Sometimes you want to test changes to a Builder against an existing project, maybe with `now dev` or an actual deployment. You can avoid publishing every Builder change to npm by uploading the Builder as a tarball.

1. Change directory to the desired Builder `cd ./packages/now-node`
2. Run `yarn build` to compile typescript and other build steps
3. Run `npm pack` to create a tarball file
4. Run `now *.tgz` to upload the tarball file and get a URL
5. Edit any existing `now.json` project and replace `use` with the URL
6. Run `now` or `now dev` to deploy with the experimental Builder
